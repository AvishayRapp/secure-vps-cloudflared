# Secure VPS with Cloudflare Tunnel + OTP SSH

This project sets up a **zero-port VPS** where:
- All inbound ports are **closed** (even SSH).
- Services are **exposed only through Cloudflare Tunnel**.
- SSH access is **restricted to approved users** via **Cloudflare Access One-Time PIN**.
- VPS IP is completely **hidden from the public internet**.

## ðŸ”’ Security Benefits
- **Zero Attack Surface** â€” No exposed IP or open ports.
- **DDoS Protection** â€” All traffic flows through Cloudflare.
- **Access Control** â€” Only approved users can connect to SSH.
- **OTP Verification** â€” Each login requires a one-time code sent via email.
- **App Isolation** â€” Multiple services can run behind the same secure tunnel.
